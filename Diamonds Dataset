## In this file, I will be using the Diamonds dataset included in RStudio to practice R and analyze data.

library(tidyverse)

View(diamonds)

colnames(diamonds)
  
diamonds %>% arrange(price)

diamonds %>% arrange(desc(price))

##  I wanted to create a plot to look at the relationship of price and cut

ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))

## This plot was too crowded so next I broke it down by cut.

ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  facet_wrap(~cut)

## Next we added color to the color variable

ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) + 
  facet_wrap(~cut)
  
## This helped show how the diamonds color impacted the price as well as the cut. 
## It appeared that most of the diamonds where in the 0-3 carat range. 
## So I decided to filter out the diamonds that where above 4 carats so the plots would be easier to read.

under_three <- diamonds %>% filter(carat<3.00) 

ggplot(under_three) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) + 
  facet_wrap(~cut)
  
## This helped show off the range of diamonds by a marginal amount, which made me question how many diamonds fell in the above 3 carat range.

under_three %>% count()

 diamonds %>% count()
 
 ## This showed that there was only a total of 40 diamonds in that range.
 ## Next I wanted to discover how many diamonds where in each cut and clarity category.
 
 diamonds %>% 
  group_by(clarity) %>% 
  count()
 
 diamonds %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  count()
